# UnivewSNvTime
A Uniview module showing observed supernovae over time, data from the [Open Supernova Catalog](https://sne.space/).

The Fork will remove the LSST Simulation Data and use UV 3.0 style data formats and directly pull from the Open Supernova Catalog. All of which is for creating a 'default' upernova module for Uniview
